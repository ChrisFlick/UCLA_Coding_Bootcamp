            What happens when you mix two of the most aggressive breeds of dogs? You get one hundred percent awsome; this is Bowie, he is a chiweenie. Half doxen, half chihuaha; all attitude. <br>

            Unlike most dogs dachshund  like to burrow which means you can often find them burrowing under piles of blankets, most importantly it means that they love to be hugged. Dachshund where breed to be used for their burrowing ability where they would chase animals into their holes on ranches making them good work dogs.<br>
            <br>
            Both dachshund  and chihuahas are known for their attitudes, tiny nepolians that like to be the boss. Since dachshunds where used for work on a ranch however they are incredibly muscular for their size making a tiny dog that can actually back up their attitude. It is important to be wary of this because they can only back themselves up if the dog is another chihuaha sized dog.
